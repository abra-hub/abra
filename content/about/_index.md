ABRA project activities aim at developing, testing, and evaluating a new transdisciplinary curriculum that
bridges artificial biology, robotics and art through the framework of sustainability. The iterative development
and testing, together with teacher training and preparation of course materials, are focused activities that
enable the consortium to identify the needs, challenges, and potentials of transdisciplinary education and
advanced degrees in HEIs. Project activities culminate in an approved transdisciplinary curriculum for an
innovative MA/MSc degree in close dialogue with relevant stakeholders that will address the main project
objectives, which are

1. to tackle the skills gaps and mismatches in students, educators, specialists/researchers
2. to promote and reward excellence in teaching and skills development through the exchange of sustainable best practices that foster creativity and innovation for addressing complex problems and solutions
3. to address environmental and climate goals

The specific transdisciplinary teaching and learning methodologies developed in IO2-3 and evaluated and reported
in IO-4, make clear the connections between the project aims and the intellectual outcomes. IO-5 and E3 and E4
make clear the potential and possibilities from transdisciplinary knowledge and education practices to wider
community of scholars, researchers, and other stakeholders. The completed application materials and approved
curriculum for the joint MA/MSc Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Degree Application (IO-6) forms the natural
culmination of the individual project activities, and is effectively the capstone for the entire project. Thus,
ABRA aims to promote innovation and sustainable changes in HE, including teacher training practices at for the
member institutions while also allowing for more systematic and strategic integration with the development of a
new European joint masters degree.

## ABRA project activities:

### IO1 – ABRA_Hub:

Aims to develop robust framework for developing and promoting the convergence of objectives and
activities between project partners. The online ABRA_Hub facilitates cooperation and networking, including an
Open Information Repository (OIR) that will be made available to other interested HEIs.

### IO2 – Course guide on transdisciplinary teaching and learning (Volume 1)

Offers practical guides and novel perspectives to transdisciplinary education and its potentialities within ABRA target fields; Artificial
Biology, Robotics, Art and Design in the context of sustainability. The EU action for Higher Education
recommends the development of teaching methods for creativity and innovation in higher education, which supports
the concretization of IO2. Designing and testing of effective and innovative study programs for higher education
is the basis of IO2.

### IO3 - Course guide on transdisciplinary teaching and learning (Volume 2)
Will follow-up on O2, and profits from the many activities planned in the second half of the project. This intellectual output will therefore benefit
from teaching and training exercises C5-8 and multiplier events E2-3 and preparations for E4. Primarily this
output is meant to be useful for teachers, educators and researchers to plan transdisciplinary HE courses in
general, and specifically the rather challenging task of cross-educational programs that combine arts,
engineering and sciences.

### IO4 – Special Journal Issue on Transdisciplinarity in Higher Education
Collects the contributions and outcome of the ABRA Curriculum Development process and Teaching and Learning Activities and making these results available
to the entire PBL research community. IO-4 looks outward to include other examples of transdisciplinary
education and curriculum across other HEIs with special consideration given to activities that relate to
sustainability.

### IO5- What Transdisciplinary Knowledge Looks Like (Exhibition and Symposium)
Is a public-facing exhibition of works produced by the transdisciplinary students of the partnering organisations as the result of the knowledge
generated within the aims and framework of the ABRA project.

### IO6 – Approved Joint Master Degree Curriculum and Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD) application
A joint master degree Curriculum that allows for an EMJMD application is one of the main ends of ABRA. A new dual
masters (MA/MSc) in artificial biology, robotics an arts is expected to impact the traditional curriculum of
these single fields, contributing to creating new work profiles of high employability. The ecological impact of
this new curriculum is also to be highlighted, since the EMJMD curriculum will be framed by sustainability
principles, creating a fundamental and intrinsic interaction between technological innovation and ecological
sustainability that it is expected to radically change the traditional interaction of these fields.
