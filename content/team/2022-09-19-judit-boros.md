Judit Boros is a design strategist and researcher interested in the intersection of the designed and the natural world. She holds a Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences, from Central European University. Her research investigates how design can contribute to sustaining and enhancing urban ecosystems. She is keen to utilize her practice and experiences in working for a turn in design practices to place ecology and the non-human at the forefront of urban design and placemaking activities and ultimately infuse 'human-centeredness' with 'nature-basedness.'
