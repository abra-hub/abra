Aalborg University, in partnership with Kunsten Museum of Modern Art, is opening the doors for a public forum on art and science with an emphasis on the topics of transdisciplinary knowledge and sustainability.

You will have the opportunity to learn about cutting edge research from biology, robotics, art, design and sustainability. Lectures and performances will highlight how artificial intelligence can revolutionize artistic practices, introduce recent creative applications using robots, and consider the limits of human individuality through poetic bio-art.

The event aims to create a space for an integrated network of experts and practitioners in transdisciplinary research and foster a lively discussion on these emerging topics. Event participation is free, however, registration in advance is required.

The event is part of a larger initiative of four universities and partners from the industry with an aim for creating a future transdisciplinary higher education programme in Europe. The project promotes knowledge alliances across the fields of artificial biology, robotics, art, and design in the context of sustainability. ABRA (Artificial Biology, Robotics, and Art) address innovation and renewal of education by developing transdisciplinary higher education methods that bridge the arts and sciences.
