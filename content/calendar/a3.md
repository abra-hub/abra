Aalborg University gathers members from 3 different departments and 2 faculties in ABRA: Department of Communication and Psychology (The Faculty of Humanities),
Department of Computer Science (The Technical Faculty of IT and Design)
Department of Architecture, Design and Media Technology (The Technical Faculty of IT and Design)
The workshop will review, discuss and create a proposed framework for how to address challenges regarding cross-department and cross-faculty collaborations in relation to (1) drawing on cross-faculty knowledge to design an inter-faculty educational programme and (2) the creation of transdisciplinary educational programmes and curricula. Issues such as dealing with students’ previous background knowledge, skills and competences will be examined alongside more practical issues of sharing laboratories and training facilities and formal degree requirements.
Staff from all the consortia partner universities will contribute to the discussion concerning the affordances and challenges of transdisciplinary education and their experiences of it within research and higher education.

# PARTICIPANTS
