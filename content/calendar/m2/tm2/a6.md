Duration: *3 days*

The 3-day workshop for teaching and administrative-staff will be a shared responsibility by Aalto University and Trento University. It will be hosted by Aalto University in Helsinki. Staff from all the consortia partner universities will contribute to the discussion concerning transdisciplinary education and their experiences of it. The workshop will focus on potentiality and challenges in the current educational structures concerning transdisciplinarity across sectors. The major part of the time will be spent in discussing the differences in the requirements for obtaining Master of Arts vs. Master of Science-degree and sustainability within education. This discussion is of importance as there are differences in requirements that put students in different positions in their possibilities to pursue transdisciplinary education, which would strengthen new areas and combinations of study and therefore also innovation potential. The aim is to find ways or suggestions how to overcome these current study requirement obstacles.
