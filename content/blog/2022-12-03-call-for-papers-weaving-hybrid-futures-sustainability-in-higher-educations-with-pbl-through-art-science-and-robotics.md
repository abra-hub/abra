The ABRA team and ABRA friends are editing a special issue for the International Journal of Problem Based Learning in Higher Education. [Find the full call for papers here.](https://journals.aau.dk/index.php/pbl/announcement/view/199) 

Join us in thinking together about entanglements across field by participating in this special issue where both research articles and graphical essays are welcome.

Defining sustainability is a double act of communication across disciplines and imagination which requires creativity and at times even speculation. How can we use often conflicting conceptions to imagine and design sustainable futures? And how should sustainability and transdisciplinarity inform education and equip future generations with the right mindset to face the challenges of their time?

This special issue addresses questions such as:

* Who defines “sustainability”? Where do the canonical discourses and ubiquitous concepts come from, and how do they become dominant narratives informing policy and decision-making. How does this enter higher educational contexts?
* How can sustainability and its principles be woven into diverse academic programmes (such as robotics, art, design, communication, etc.)?
* How should we scaffold productive collaborations across disciplines (for example art+science+engineering) to help us imagine and design sustainable futures?
* How can PBL help create more diverse educational pathways, enact transdisciplinary engagement, and bridge understandings from the arts, humanities and social sciences with those from the natural sciences, computer science, and engineering? (STEM+ arts=STEAM)
