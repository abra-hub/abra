title: Our Robots, Our Selves
description: Today, robots continue to shape our ideas and expectations about
  the role of technology in our everyday lives. Just like the automata of
  centuries past, impressive performances of robots in the media by companies
  like Honda, Boston Dynamics, Yaskawa, and others, frequently present robots as
  more capable than they really are, masking the very real technical and social
  challenges that remain. These exaggerated performances contribute to public
  misunderstanding and unrealistic expectations about robots, AI, and technology
  more broadly.
