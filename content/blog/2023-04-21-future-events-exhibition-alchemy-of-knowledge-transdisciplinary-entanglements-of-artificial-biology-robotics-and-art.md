An exhibition of multimedial works of art, science and engineering, created by the multidisciplinary students of the ABRA (Artificial Biology, Robotics and Art) project.

The exhibition features the collaborative works of the students, faculty and experts who had worked jointly across the fields of science, technology, art, design, and cultures. The exhibition also showcases the methods and practices of higher education that were researched and tested during the ABRA project. These works narrate how we may bridge the art and science for enhanced sustainability and renewal of education.

**Daniel Szalai - Algorithmic Alchemy of Cows**

What will the cow of the future look like if its evolution is to be controlled entirely by algorithms and managed according to a selection principle that prioritises the cow's compatibility with the technological infrastructure and its efficiency in serving economic goals? The artwork *Algorithmic Alchemy of Cows* uses machine learning to address this issue and raise questions about humankind's relationship to nature and technology. Following a speculative attitude, it projects various evolutionary trajectories of cattle using GANs trained on images of cows obtained from Holstein Friesian sire directories.

Cow Alchemy *is a project by artist Dániel Szalai, developed and realised together with Dániel Rácz and Marcell Mesterházi at* SZTAKI*, under the scope of the* Artificial Biology, Robotics and Art “ABRA” *project supported by the* Erasmus+ *programme of the* European Union*. Further support from the* Goethe-Institut Munich*,* Library and Information Department*.*

**Renata Dezso - Co-Ability / Aberrant behaviour in system aesthetic**

My work with ABRA challenges binary thinking and advocate for concepts that embrace complexity. Through an exploration of the co-Ability phenomenon, I highlight how a complex network is more than the sum of its parts. Through a transdisciplinary design exploration, I use 3D-printed tangible prototypes as a medium to engage with philosophical discussions that challenge Western thinking and therefore the concept of binary oppositions. My work exemplifies a "Trans-Disciplinary" approach that integrates art, design, science, and technology as equal partners in a decentralised creative process.

Rather than focusing solely on creating a final design product for problem-solving in soft robotics, my intention is to employ a problem-seeking method. This approach allows the design process to generate new ideas, taking into account the diversity and complexity of real-world experiences. In contrast to object-oriented approaches, problem-seeking in this project involves the development of partial micro-solutions reflected in prototypes that challenge systems-oriented settings, considering the temporality of materials, movements, and changes.

Working with digital technology has been an exploratory endeavour shaped by the influence of time and progress. The objects I create through material fabrication are intended to reflect and provoke thoughts on relationships within soft networks while emphasising aesthetics that are culturally relevant, technically advanced, and visually captivating.

**Aska Mayer, Johanna Møberg Lauritzen - Estroextract - Speculative protocols on care and contamination of (human) bodies of water**

Yearly, 113.000 kg of estrogenic hormones are released into the environment by humans and livestock, contaminating entire bodies of water and the surrounding earth. With these rapidly increasing concentrations in soil and water all over the world, we can’t avoid being shaped by those hormones.

While these omnipresent estrogens are concealed in our surroundings, the selected distribution of the same components within institutional “healthcare” is subject to heavy gatekeeping and is used as a mechanism for control and repression. Access to hormone-based medical procedures is a process of passing arbitrary artificial obstacles to receive care, which should be perceived as a necessity. That is, if the care is even available or accessible at all.

Taking this contamination and control of estrogens as a starting point, we imagine an alternative approach to hormone-based healthcare:

We desire to define a chemical protocol that can transform hormone pollution, which is harmful for the natural environment, into necessary treatment of human bodies. We envision this protocol offering new possibilities for those seeking estrogen-based medical care, who are currently unable to access it through institutional healthcare systems. Furthermore, we hope that the protocol can help facilitate and inspire the growth of community-based healthcare, giving people the right to care for their own bodies, on their own terms, surrounded by familiar, mutually caring individuals.

Combining imaginative practices with scientific research, Estroextract takes the shape of a speculative experimental setup for a future utilization of estrogenic contamination within small-scale communities. This information is conveyed through  speculative blueprints for a bioreactor and other materials needed for extracting estrogens from wastewater, as well as a sample of the desired estrogen hydrogel product. Accompanying this, is a video explaining the motivation and hopes of the project, water samples collected from multiple locations in Europe, and posters displaying these locations.

**Katri Naukkarinen, Aurora Del Rio, Markus Löchtefeld - Decay Cyphers**

Decay Cyphers is part of the speculative Atomic Kinship research project, founded with the aim of re-visioning radioactivity as a deity. The artists are re-appropriating the idea of forming a cult of radioactivity as a way of transmitting warning messages into deep future.

Decay Cyphers focuses on research around organic materials affected by the Chernobyl fallout in Finland. The artwork presents a designed algorithm which is caught in the attempt of decoding messages from radioactive ashes. The work plays with the space of potentiality in-between ‘failure’ and ‘miracle’ in relation to the expected result of finding a message.

**Maros Pekarik, Andrea Tesanovic - Molecular Theatre performance**

"Molecular Theatre” is an art-science project that explores the fascinating world of protocells – cell-like entities which allow for life-like behavior to spontaneously emerge from non-living chemicals. Through the fusion of scientific inquiry and artistic expression, the project aims to create a unique sensory experience by giving voice to non-living agents of synthetic biology through generative soundscapes. These soundscapes are derived from the behaviors of protocells as they interact with each other and with their environment and serve as a window into the inner workings of these mysterious structures. The opening of the exhibition at the Art Quarter Budapest will feature a live collaboration between artists and protocells, as they come together to generate a one-of-a-kind sound piece followed by a permanent installation showcasing the experiments and the soundscapes generated by the protocells.
