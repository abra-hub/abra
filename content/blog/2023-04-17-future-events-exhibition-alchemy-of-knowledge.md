**Alchemy of Knowledge - Transdisciplinary entanglements of Artificial Biology, Robotics, and Art**

Place: [aqb Project Space](https://facebook.com/aqbprojectspace)

Exhibition opening: May 12. 16:00 CET

Facebook link:[ https://fb.me/e/CgaLkhc2](https://fb.me/e/CgaLkhc2)

An exhibition of multimedial works of art, science and engineering, created by the multidisciplinary students of the ABRA (Artificial Biology, Robotics and Art) project.

The exhibition features the collaborative works of the students, faculty and experts who had worked jointly across the fields of science, technology, art, design, and cultures. The exhibition also showcases the methods and practices of higher education that were researched and tested during the ABRA project. These works narrate how we may bridge the art and science for enhanced sustainability and renewal of education.

**SYMPOSIUM**

ABRA symposium - ***"What transdisciplinary knowledge looks like"***

Place: MOME auditorium

Time: May 10, 15.30-19.00

 Facebook link - <https://fb.me/e/61KIFYKPT>

The "What Transdisciplinary Knowledge Looks Like" symposium showcases contemporary knowledge alchemists: designers, artists, and scientists who transcend disciplinary boundaries in order to discover and to test alternative projections of technologies and modes of thinking. Are they rogue agents of provocation, or pioneers of future professions?

ABRA (Artificial Biology, Robotics and Art) project in collaboration with MOME invites educators, students, researchers, designers, artists, and scientists to jointly envision a bridge between possibilities in transdisciplinary education and the professions of tomorrow.

ABRA is a pilot project for cultivating transdisciplinary higher education and capacity building in science and arts. The project is focused on entanglement of artificial biology, robotics, art and design for enhanced social and environmental sustainability.
